## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### ✅ Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IOCOfficial/CaseManagement/main/setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### 🧩 Option 2: Manual Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/IOCOfficial/CaseManagement.git Investigations
cd Investigations
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧠 Optional: Enable ChatGPT Integration

To use AI-powered summaries in your reports:

Get your API key from OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Add it to your terminal environment:

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```
Restart the terminal or your Python script

---

## 📦 Vault Template Setup (Obsidian)

1. Export Your Obsidian Vault Template
```
mkdir -p ~/vault_template
cp -R "/path/to/your/vault/.obsidian" ~/vault_template/
```

Example (iCloud Path):
```
mkdir -p ~/vault_template
cp -R "/Users/b52/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/IOC Vault/211024EA CRYPTOBOSSUK/.obsidian" ~/vault_template/
```

You can also use:
```
rsync -avh "/path/to/vault/.obsidian/" ~/vault_template/.obsidian/
```
This prevents issues with extended file attributes on macOS.

### 2. Point the script to this template folder:
In your Python script:
```
VAULT_TEMPLATE = os.path.expanduser("~/vault_template/.obsidian")
```

## 📝 Usage
Run the script:
```
python3 main.py
```
